        <h2>"River of Life: Visualizing the Yangtze's Story"</h2>
         <p>
          The Yangtze River, flowing over 3915 miles, epitomizes a living artery, carrying memories, culture, and life from the Tanggula Mountains to the East China Sea. To unravel the abstract and intimate interactions between water, life, and memory, we propose an immersive real-time 3D (RT3D) project that will echo Chinese culture's linguistic traditions and its intricate relationship with nature.
</p>
<p>
The Chinese words for mountain (山, shan) and water (水, shui) are not just geographical features but encapsulate profound cultural imaginations and ecological wisdom. By drawing upon the legacy of Shan and Shui, we aim to create a digital representation of the Yangtze River watershed's microcosms. This immersive experience would allow users to understand the river's civilization in an interactive and sensitive way, slicing and interpreting the historical, ecological, and cultural aspects.
</p>
<p>
Our project aims to straddle the worlds of modern technology and traditional knowledge, blending the hydrological studies' information richness with the innate wisdom of phenology, bio indicators, and time-space construction. In doing so, we hope to illuminate alternate narratives of human interaction with the environment, fostering a "wet togetherness" in an era where water is increasingly viewed through the lens of technology.
</p>
<p>
By employing Unity's RT3D technology, we intend to construct a digital trailscape, a virtual world that morphs in response to user interaction. In this trailscape, users can understand the Yangtze's culture and environment via virtual markers, steps taken along the way, or the fluctuating water levels of the Dongting Lake.
</p>
<p>
Tailored for the 2023 WORLDING Unity Incubator, this project targets the intersection of storytelling, climate change, XR, and land use decision-making. By generating an immersive 3D experience, we aspire to stimulate informed discussions around climate change and ecological sustainability in real-life communities residing along the Yangtze.
</p>
<p>
Our team is prepared for several ideation and planning sessions in spring and summer 2023. We believe our project aligns with the initiative's goal of investigating technology-assisted future-versioning and co-creative approach, visualizing sustainable worlds using real-time 3D technologies, and enabling them to become a reality. We look forward to a constructive and inspiring exchange with the MIT departments, Unity team, and special guests in the fall of 2023.
